# The Five Rings — VMSS Civilization (Full Site)

A voluntary civilization framework built on moral causality, layered governance, continuity, and consequence.

**Version:** 15.9.5
**Live site:** https://jasonhuang24.github.io/VMSS/
**Lite site:** https://jasonhuang24.github.io/VMSSLite/
**Whitepaper:** https://jasonhuang24.github.io/VMSS/whitepaper.html

## About

The Five Rings is a proposed civilization model organized around five concentric governance rings (+1 to -3). Citizens are placed in rings based on demonstrated behavior — not birth, wealth, or ideology. The system combines technoneural enforcement, a Social Trust Index, automation-funded UBI, backup vessel continuity, and consequence-bound freedom into a single coherent architecture.

This is the **full site** — the complete doctrine portal with interactive tools, detailed layer dossiers with narrative simulations, STI console, current-state technology annotations, a 15-page paginated whitepaper, and extended FAQ edge cases.

A **lite version** of the site exists at the companion repository (VMSSLite) for readers who want the full doctrine in a faster, more focused reading experience.

## Key Concepts

**VMSS** — Vertical Moral Stratification System. Behavioral stratification replaces incarceration. Layer placement is a permanent environmental consequence of demonstrated conduct, not a time sentence.

**STI** — Social Trust Index. A separate ledger for non-criminal trust violations. Covers harms that fall below legal thresholds — fraud, chronic deception, harassment — and makes them socially legible without criminalizing them. Operates on two distinct tracks: social trust violations (STI) and hard behavioral flags (criminal record log).

**Backup Vessels** — Periodic encrypted mind-state backups. Fabrication is sovereign VMSS technology. Revival is binary: full fidelity or failure. In -1 and -2, continuity is serviced through VMSS-operated fabrication satellite installations. In -3 Terminal, the implant severs the backup vessel link at the hardware level — death is final.

**Neural Diving** — Direct mind-to-mind interface technology. Audience mode (passive observation) and Pilot mode (temporary control, requires consent). The civilization's primary medium for empathy, education, and art.

**SADs** — Selective Ascension Domains. Opt-in metric-gated domains within +1 Sanctuary, each filtered by a single measurable criterion. Citizens may qualify for multiple simultaneously.

**Governance** — Three-body structure: President (chief executive, drawn from Meritboard), Meritboard (50–100 members, credentialing body), Supreme Court (10 justices, edge-case jurisdiction). No elections. Competence is measured, not campaigned for.

**Leakage** — The gap between stated consequence and actual consequence delivery. Starting reality: ~90%. Founding aspiration: 0%. Target by 3000: ~0.01%.

## Companion Repository

The **VMSSLite** repository contains a condensed version of the site — same doctrine, faster read. No interactive widgets, no current-state annotations, condensed pages, six archetypal simulations instead of the full archive. Ideal for first-time readers.
